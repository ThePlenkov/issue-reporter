# GitHub Issue Management System

A systematic approach to investigating problems, managing GitHub issues, and tracking resolutions across multiple platforms and projects.

## 🎯 Why This Project Exists

Managing GitHub issues effectively requires more than just creating tickets. It demands:

- **Structured Problem Investigation**: Systematic analysis of issues with comprehensive documentation
- **Cross-Platform Tracking**: Issues may span GitHub, GitLab, Reddit, and other platforms
- **Long-term Status Tracking**: Following issues from submission through resolution
- **Workflow Standardization**: Consistent processes for problem analysis and issue management
- **Comprehensive Research**: Finding existing solutions and related work before creating new issues

This project provides a complete workflow and tooling for professional-grade issue management.

## 🚀 How It Helps

### For Individual Developers
- **Never Lose Track**: Complete documentation of problems and their status
- **Research First**: Automatically find existing solutions before creating duplicate issues
- **Professional Workflow**: Structured approach that scales from simple bugs to complex features
- **Multi-Platform**: Manage issues across GitHub, GitLab, forums, and community platforms

### For Teams
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Documented investigations become team knowledge
- **Process Consistency**: Standardized workflows across team members
- **Status Transparency**: Clear visibility into issue progress and blockers
- **Scalable Organization**: Handles simple bugs to complex multi-repo investigations

### For Open Source Maintainers
- **Better Issue Quality**: Well-researched issues with comprehensive context
- **Reduced Duplicates**: Systematic checking of existing issues and solutions
- **Clearer Communication**: Structured problem descriptions with all necessary context
- **Easier Triage**: Status tracking and cross-references help prioritize work

```

### Future Platforms
The structure supports expansion to other platforms:
- `gitlab/projects/` - GitLab issues and merge requests
- `reddit/posts/` - Community discussions and feature requests
- `discord/channels/` - Community support and discussions

## 🔄 The Problem Investigation Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Problem Details
- Complete problem description and reproduction steps
- Environment details and affected systems
- Expected vs actual behavior analysis

### Step 2: Find Relevant Projects
- Identify appropriate repositories/platforms
- Research existing solutions and workarounds
- Cross-reference with related issues

### Step 3: Analyze and Document
- Structured problem documentation
- Impact assessment and priority evaluation
- Solution research and feasibility analysis

### Step 4: Draft Issues (if needed)
- Platform-specific issue templates
- Comprehensive context and reproduction steps
- Links to related work and existing solutions

### Step 5: Submit and Track
- Automated issue submission to target platforms
- Status tracking from submission to resolution
- Update documentation as issues progress

## 🛠️ Tools and Features

### Workflow Automation (`/problem`)
- Interactive problem investigation workflow
- Automatic research and cross-referencing
- Platform-specific issue drafting
- Status tracking and updates

### Documentation System
- **Problems**: Complete investigations with status tables
- **Projects**: Platform-specific indexes with issue tracking
- **Issues**: Numbered drafts with full context
- **Cross-references**: Links between related problems and solutions

### Multi-Platform Support
- **GitHub**: Issues, pull requests, discussions
- **GitLab**: Issues, merge requests
- **Community**: Reddit posts, Discord threads, forums
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new platforms

## 📋 Example Usage

### Investigating a Docker MCP Toolkit Issue

1. **Start Investigation**:
   ```bash
   /problem "Docker MCP Toolkit token usage issues"
   ```

2. **Follow Workflow**:
   - Describe the problem (token consumption, IDE limits)
   - Research existing solutions (mcp-filter, MCP Gateway & Registry)
   - Find relevant repositories (docker/mcp-gateway)
   - Draft comprehensive issues with full context

3. **Track Progress**:
   - Issues submitted: #186, #187
   - Status tracking in problem documentation
   - Updates as maintainers respond

4. **Result**: Two well-researched feature requests submitted to Docker with complete context and existing solution analysis.

## 🎯 Key Principles

### Research First
- Always check for existing solutions before creating new issues
- Cross-reference with related work and implementations
- Provide comprehensive context to maintainers

### Structured Documentation
- Complete problem analysis in dedicated folders
- Status tracking tables for all submitted issues
- Cross-platform references and relationships

### Professional Workflow
- Systematic approach to problem investigation
- Comprehensive issue templates with all context
- Long-term tracking from submission to resolution
