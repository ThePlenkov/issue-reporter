# AI-First Problem Investigation & Issue Management System

> **Demonstrating AI-Driven Workflow Development**  
> This entire system—workflows, structure, and documentation—was created using AI agents (initially Grok, now Windsurf/Cascade). It proves that AI can design systematic processes, not just execute tasks.

## 🤖 The Revolutionary Approach

### Traditional Problem-Solving
1. Encounter problem → 2. Create ad-hoc issue → 3. Hope for response

### AI-First Workflow-Driven Approach
1. **AI Designs Workflow** → 2. **AI Executes Systematically** → 3. **AI Documents & Learns**

## 🎯 Why This Changes Everything

**Before**: Issue management was manual, inconsistent, platform-specific  
**After**: AI creates reusable workflows that work across any platform

### Core Innovation
- **Workflow-as-Code**: AI writes the investigation process itself
- **Platform Agnostic**: Works with GitHub, GitLab, Reddit, forums, Discord—any platform
- **Self-Improving**: Each investigation refines the workflow
- **Knowledge Capture**: Tacit knowledge becomes explicit and reusable

### What This System Does

1. **Systematic Investigation**: AI-designed workflow ensures thorough analysis
2. **Comprehensive Research**: Automatically finds existing solutions and related work
3. **Multi-Platform Support**: Submit to GitHub, discuss on Reddit, document everywhere
4. **Status Tracking**: Follow issues from creation through resolution
5. **Continuous Learning**: Workflows improve based on outcomes

## 🚀 How It Helps

### For Individual Developers
- **Never Lose Track**: Complete documentation of problems and their status
- **Research First**: Automatically find existing solutions before creating duplicate issues
- **Professional Workflow**: Structured approach that scales from simple bugs to complex features
- **Multi-Platform**: Manage issues across GitHub, GitLab, forums, and community platforms

### For Teams
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Documented investigations become team knowledge
- **Process Consistency**: Standardized workflows across team members
- **Status Transparency**: Clear visibility into issue progress and blockers
- **Scalable Organization**: Handles simple bugs to complex multi-repo investigations

### For Open Source Maintainers
- **Better Issue Quality**: Well-researched issues with comprehensive context
- **Reduced Duplicates**: Systematic checking of existing issues and solutions
- **Clearer Communication**: Structured problem descriptions with all necessary context
- **Easier Triage**: Status tracking and cross-references help prioritize work

## 📁 Project Structure

```
├── .windsurf/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── problem.md           # Main problem investigation workflow
├── problems/                    # Problem investigations and documentation
│   └── [problem-name]/
│       └── README.md           # Complete problem analysis + status tracking
├── github/                      # Platform-specific organization
│   └── projects/               # GitHub projects
│       └── [owner]/[repo]/
│           ├── README.md       # Project index with issue references
│           └── issues/         # Issue drafts (named by issue number)
└── README.md                   # This file
```

### Future Platforms
The structure supports expansion to other platforms:
- `gitlab/projects/` - GitLab issues and merge requests
- `reddit/posts/` - Community discussions and feature requests
- `discord/channels/` - Community support and discussions

## 🔄 The Problem Investigation Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Problem Details
- Complete problem description and reproduction steps
- Environment details and affected systems
- Expected vs actual behavior analysis

### Step 2: Find Relevant Projects
- Identify appropriate repositories/platforms
- Research existing solutions and workarounds
- Cross-reference with related issues

### Step 3: Analyze and Document
- Structured problem documentation
- Impact assessment and priority evaluation
- Solution research and feasibility analysis

### Step 4: Draft Issues (if needed)
- Platform-specific issue templates
- Comprehensive context and reproduction steps
- Links to related work and existing solutions

### Step 5: Submit and Track
- Automated issue submission to target platforms
- Status tracking from submission to resolution
- Update documentation as issues progress

## 🛠️ Tools and Features

### Workflow Automation (`/problem`)
- Interactive problem investigation workflow
- Automatic research and cross-referencing
- Platform-specific issue drafting
- Status tracking and updates

### Documentation System
- **Problems**: Complete investigations with status tables
- **Projects**: Platform-specific indexes with issue tracking
- **Issues**: Numbered drafts with full context
- **Cross-references**: Links between related problems and solutions

### Multi-Platform Support
- **GitHub**: Issues, pull requests, discussions
- **GitLab**: Issues, merge requests
- **Community**: Reddit posts, Discord threads, forums
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new platforms

## 📋 Example Usage

### Investigating a Docker MCP Toolkit Issue

1. **Start Investigation**:
   ```bash
   /problem "Docker MCP Toolkit token usage issues"
   ```

2. **Follow Workflow**:
   - Describe the problem (token consumption, IDE limits)
   - Research existing solutions (mcp-filter, MCP Gateway & Registry)
   - Find relevant repositories (docker/mcp-gateway)
   - Draft comprehensive issues with full context

3. **Track Progress**:
   - Issues submitted: #186, #187
   - Status tracking in problem documentation
   - Updates as maintainers respond

4. **Result**: Two well-researched feature requests submitted to Docker with complete context and existing solution analysis.

## 🎯 Key Principles

### Research First
- Always check for existing solutions before creating new issues
- Cross-reference with related work and implementations
- Provide comprehensive context to maintainers

### Structured Documentation
- Complete problem analysis in dedicated folders
- Status tracking tables for all submitted issues
- Cross-platform references and relationships

### Professional Workflow
- Systematic approach to problem investigation
- Comprehensive issue templates with all context
- Long-term tracking from submission to resolution

## 🤝 Contributing
